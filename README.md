## Introduction
Quest can perform common descriptive statistics operations and generate a scatter plot and a distribution plot, based on an input file which contains numbers delimited by whitespace. It can be used like this:
```
python3 main.py --file my_file.txt
```

## Features
### Scatter Plot
- Generates plot
- Calculates mean
- Calculates median
- Generates regression line
### Distribution Plot
- Generates plot
- Calculates mode
- Calculates mean frequency

## TODO
- <s>Mean, median, mode</s>
- <s>Regression</s>
- Range, IQR
- Variance, standard deviation, correlation
